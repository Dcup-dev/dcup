# Choose Your Adventure

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers: API First Steps

### 1. Sign Up and Log In
Before you can start using Dcup Cloud, you‚Äôll need to create an account and log in [Here](https://dcup.dev/login).

### 2. Generate Your API Key
After logging in, navigate to the Integrations page in your dashboard. Here, you can generate your unique API key, which is required for all API calls.
- **Find Your API Key: Your API key will be displayed once generated. Keep it secure and do not share it publicly.**

### 3. Making Your First API Call
Dcup Cloud‚Äôs API is designed to be simple and powerful. Below are examples of how to use your API key in a request.

#### A. Cleaning Files
If you want to clean up files (like PDFs, DOCs, PPTs, CSVs), include your files in the form data with the key files. For example, using JavaScript‚Äôs fetch API:
```js
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
const url = 'https://api.dcup.dev/v1/clean/file';
const formData = new FormData();

// Append your file(s) and schema to the form data
formData.append('files', fileInput);
formData.append('schema', requiredSchema);

await fetch(url, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
  },
  body: formData,
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

```
#### B. Cleaning with Links
If you want to clean data directly from URLs, simply include the URL(s) as query parameters:
```js
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
const urlDoc = 'https://example.com/document.pdf';
const url = `https://api.dcup.dev/v1/clean?url=${urlDoc}`;

// Append your schema to the form data
formData.append('schema', requiredSchema);

await fetch(url, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
  },
  body: formData,
})
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));

```

### 4. Web App Magic for Business Users
For non-developers or business users who prefer a visual interface, Dcup Cloud offers a powerful web app experience.

#### Step 1: Upload Your File
- Drag-and-Drop: Simply drag and drop a file (PDF, DOC, PPT, CSV, etc.) into the designated area.
