üöÄ Dcup is your go-to solution for building and scaling Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Whether you‚Äôre a developer looking to integrate AI-driven search capabilities or a team wanting to harness data for smarter retrieval, Dcup is fully open-source, self-hostable, and built with scalability in mind.

## ‚ú® Key Features
- **Fully Open Source & Self-Hostable:** Maintain control over your data and infrastructure.
- **Connected RAG:** Easy-to-use integrations with Google Drive, Dropbox, AWS, and direct file uploads.
- **Advanced Search Capabilities:** LLM re-ranking, summary indexing, hybrid search using OpenAI embeddings and Qdrant vector storage.
- **Intuitive Retrieval API:** Seamlessly query and refine your data with optional re-ranking.
- **Developer-Centric:** With clear documentation, easy-to-use APIs, and a modular architecture.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è How Dcup Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Ingest
Start by ingesting your data. Dcup offers simple APIs for uploading files or directly connecting to popular sources like Google Drive, Dropbox, and AWS. Your data stays up-to-date automatically with effortless syncing.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Chunk and Index
Once ingested, Dcup automatically chunks and embeds your data into vectors using OpenAI embeddings. The vectors are stored in a scalable Qdrant vector database, with indexing for enhanced retrieval (vector, summary, and keyword indexing).

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Retrieve
The final step is retrieval. With the Dcup Retrieval API, you can query your data and refine results. Features like re-ranking, summary index, entity extraction, flexible filtering, and hybrid search (semantic + keyword) ensure high precision and relevant results for your AI applications.
