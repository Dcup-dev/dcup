# Dcup: The Ultimate Open-Source RAG Platform

ðŸ“– **Open Source, Now and Forever**

Dcup is a fully open-source, self-hostable data pipeline designed to revolutionize how you process and retrieve information from unstructured documents. Our mission is to empower developers, data engineers, and AI teams with a powerful tool that transforms raw data into structured, actionable insights.

## Overview

Dcup leverages advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to convert PDFs, Docs, Sheets, HTML, Markdown, and more into perfectly structured JSON. By combining an intuitive, flexible ingestion process with intelligent text chunking and indexing, Dcup makes it easy to query your data with precision and efficiency.
